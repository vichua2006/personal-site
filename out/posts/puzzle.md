I miss those store-bought puzzles from my childhood.

Those corner pieces and edges were always easy to find,
with their flat and distinctive sides.
They'd always go first, the rest would swiftly follow
and in no time, the pieces would all combine together,
satisfyingly, into a pretty little picture.

But now, its different. I'm lost, between these thousands pieces,
of millions colors and shapes
with no clear image in mind.
They are contradicting, ambiguous,
yet sometimes sharply defined,
with no corner pieces to even anchor upon.

in this chaos without beginning or end,
how am I meant to piece together
this puzzle that is myself?
