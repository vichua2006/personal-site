{"pageProps":{"content":"> This dude finally got a personal website\r\n>\t\t- [cll](https://www.chinglamlau.ca), probably  \r\n\r\nWelcome! Hopefully you've had a good time so far.\r\nWith few days remaining until the new summer semester (2A), I decided it was time to finally give myself some digial presence (and as a way to procrastinate on revamping my resume), and so here you go! Brand new personal website for the world. \r\n\r\nThis site is built with React + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (10/10, I have been converted), which finally put that React course I bought 2 years ago to good use. Unfortunately, the reality is that I did a pretty crappy job, and those of you who are keen (and bored enough to actually look at my code) may realize the issue:\r\n\r\n- my component layout makes absolutely no sense in retrospect, and\r\n- I used *only* React, so all these posts are also rendered client-side.  \r\n\r\nThe first point refers to the spotlight effect. Secondly, *all* the markdown files thus have to be public assets and sent over upon any request, which isn't that big of a problem unless I write a bjillion writing entries (or unless somehow this site becomes popular), but also just makes me feel like a crappy dev. Probably should have done a bit more research before I started 😋.\r\n\r\nDesign inspiration goes to [Billy Tseng](https://www.billytseng.com/), [Wilbur Zhang](https://www.wilburzhang.com/), [Ching Lam Lau](https://www.chinglamlau.ca/), and [Ivan Yu](https://ivan-yu.ca/). Believe it or not, I actually thought of the spotlight idea separated from [Hack the North 2025 teaser](https://hackthenorth.com/), but it's too similar for me to claim otherwise. The color theme doesn't help either.\r\n\r\nNow, the question to be answered: when am I going to fix these issues?\r\n\r\nYour guess is as good as mine.\r\n","metadata":{"title":"On the Creation of This Site","description":"hello-world","date":"05-04-2025","slug":"about-site"}},"__N_SSG":true}
