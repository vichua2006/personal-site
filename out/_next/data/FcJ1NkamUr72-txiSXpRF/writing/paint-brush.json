{"pageProps":{"content":"one day, the painter picked up the new paint brush from the store.\r\n\r\nit danced happily across the canvas, leaving behind beautiful strokes of color:\r\n\r\nfiery shades of red, ice splashes of blue, luscious traces of green, and sparkling spots of violet. \r\n\r\nbut the painter wanted more, something more colorful, more beautiful,\r\n\r\nmore perfect.\r\n\r\ngladly, the brush absorbed more colors, and yet, the paintings did not become more vibrant. \r\n\r\ninstead, red mixed with green and became the color of spoiled mustard, while violet and blue grew a dark, messy patch of mold.\r\n\r\nFrustrated, scared, and confused, the painter continued to paint.\r\n\r\nwith each new color, the brush dimmed; orange, teal, scarlet, emerald, navy, all mixed together into a dark, unpleasant grey.\r\n\r\nat the end, with one final defeated thrust, the brush slammed onto canvas. \r\n\r\nPaint, as dark as ink, exploded upon the once vibrant surface and splattered as far as the eye could see.\r\n\r\nno longer being able to paint anything but black, the painter backed away with a helpless smile.\r\n\r\nthe brush fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nit yearned for water. Afterall, what good is a brush if it can't change color?\r\n\r\nbut perhaps, it also isn't all that bad.\r\n","metadata":{"title":"Paint Brush","description":"adaptation","date":"05-05-2025","slug":"paint-brush"}},"__N_SSG":true}
