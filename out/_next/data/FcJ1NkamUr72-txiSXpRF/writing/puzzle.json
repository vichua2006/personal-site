{"pageProps":{"content":"I miss those store-bought puzzles from my childhood.\r\n\r\nThose corner pieces and edges were always easy to find,\r\nwith their flat and distinctive sides.\r\nThey'd always go first, the rest would swiftly follow\r\nand in no time, the pieces would all combine together,\r\nsatisfyingly, into a pretty little picture.\r\n\r\nBut now, its different. I'm lost, between these thousands pieces,\r\nof millions colors and shapes\r\nwith no clear image in mind.\r\nThey are contradicting, ambiguous,\r\nyet sometimes sharply defined,\r\nwith no corner pieces to even anchor upon.\r\n\r\nin this chaos without beginning or end,\r\nhow am I meant to piece together\r\nthis puzzle that is myself?\r\n","metadata":{"title":"Puzzle","description":"lost","date":"08-23-2025","slug":"puzzle"}},"__N_SSG":true}
