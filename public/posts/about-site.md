Welcome! Hopefully you've had a good time so far.
With few days remaining until the new summer semester (2A), I decided it was time to finally give myself some digial presence (and as a way to procrastinate on revamping my resume), and so here you go! Brand new personal website for the world. 

This site is build with React + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (10/10, I have been converted), which finally put that React course I bought 2 years ago to good use. Unfortunately, the reality is that I did a pretty crappy job, and those of you who are keen (and bored enough to actually look at my code) may realize the issue:

- my component layout makes absolutely no sense in retrospect, and
- I used *only* React, so all these posts are also rendered client-side.  

The first point refers to the spotlight effect. Secondly, *all* the markdown files thus have to be public assets and sent over upon any request, which isn't that big of a problem unless I write a bjillion writing entries (or unless somehow this site becomes popular), but also just makes me feel like a crappy dev. Probably should have done a bit more research before I started ðŸ˜‹.

Design inspiration goes to [Billy Tseng](https://www.billytseng.com/), [Wilbur Zhang](https://www.wilburzhang.com/), [Ching Lam Lau](https://www.chinglamlau.ca/), and [Ivan Yu](https://ivan-yu.ca/). Believe it or not, I actually thought of the spotlight idea seperate from [Hack the North 2025 teaser](https://hackthenorth.com/), but it's too similar for me to claim otherwise. The color theme doesn't help either.

Now, the question to be answered: when am I going to fix these issues?

Your guess is as good as mine.
