I want to see the ocean,

away from all the gray and noise,

next to blue as far as the eye could see,

to listen to the calming waves,

to feel the seaside breeze,

and to be carried adrift,

washed upon the shore of happiness,

where there's nothing but blue,

and the sound of her joyous laughter.
