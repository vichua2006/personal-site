it has been a while 
since I've last seen
that smile of yours.

each one,
precious like a gem,
shined brilliantly
under that faint,
but ever-present mask
of melancholy.

Your hair, lengthened 
by our time apart,
swayed before me
as you briskly walked past,
with newfound happiness
stretched across your lips,

without a trace of sorrow.

and yet,
why does such a beautiful smile,

wring my heart so?
