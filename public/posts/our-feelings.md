O these feelings of ours,
swerving around all sense and logic,
fiercely colliding beneath our consciousness
exploding with shards of shrapnel,
of wonderous shapes and colors
that cut deeply into our hearts.

but together, 
as though playing a game of tag, we'll cast a net 
around these mischievous little spirits,
and trap them within a box, 
where perhaps someday, in the not-so-distant future,
we'll set them free upon autumn's night sky,
and they shall dance like blazing stars and comets
for us to laugh and see.
