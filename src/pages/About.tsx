        If being a theatre technician has taught me anything in life, it's that
        helping others shine brings twice the joyâ€”because when the actors
        perform their best, the audience shares in that magic. There's
        something deeply fulfilling about working behind the scenes to make
        everything run smoothly.

        essential in enabling others to succeed, connect, and create something
        meaningful.
